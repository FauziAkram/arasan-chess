1. Produce a signed M1 executable for Mac

2. FRC

3. implement UCI_Opponent

4. Change reduction/pruning based on node type - does not work so far.

5. Book learning. Dropout expansion? Implement a system for learning from self-play games.

6. Further LazySMP improvements:
   a. see http://www.tckerrigan.com/Chess/Parallel_Search/Simplified_ABDADA/
   b. improve thread depth distribution logic, see: http://talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=68154. - done, needs more testing though.

7. revist NUMA support. This code has not been updated/tested for a while.
Consider memory striping for hash. Rebind memory on thread resize.

8. Windows GUI badly needs a rewrite, better graphics.

9. UCI "go" command with fixed node count is not supported at present.

10. Experiment with different, possibly deeper, networks.

11. Further parameter tuning.
